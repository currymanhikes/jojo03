Referential mistakes not fixed but noted...
- Lesson 4 says that John 1:23 is 2:23 - other errors follow trom that initial error. The initial error originated from the original files; existent in original site files also.
- Lesson 6, John 4:19-26 references a "20". The "20" should be deleted.

BibleGateway.com links in the Gospel of John Study
These links are left in even though we know that BibleGateway.com may fail in China in years to come.
We decided against a site in China as it would be tracked. However it may be that we could look at storing these three sections on GitHub!!
1.) pp 31 John 11
2.) pp 37 John 13
3.) pp 58 Colossians 1:13-20

It should be noted that there was one link that may have been lost in the process of revision.
Around John 15, there is the teaching of Jesus being the vine and we being the branches. The author went to great extent to describe the growth of a grape vine and included at least one picture, possibly more, to help the reader understand more clearly Jesus analogy between the vine and the branches. That link was broken and has not been restored with a new link. The exact location of the link is unknown, but if one were to read  carefully around John 15, you would find it easily.
